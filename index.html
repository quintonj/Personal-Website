                  <h4>The Product</h4>
                  <p>During the summer of 2018, I will be serving as a UX designer apprentice for the repairs team at The Home Depot. Within this team, I will be assisting with researching and designing Repair Depot. This is a comprehensive product that allows in-store technicians to quickly and easily manage inventory, order parts, and keep track of repairs. Repairs are currently managed by a legacy system that is not intuitive, slow, and has limited accessibility. As a result, our team has set out to solve this issue with Repair Depot. Throughout the course of my apprenticeship, I will be conducting user interviews, observing technicians in store, designing and producing prototypes, and more. Please stay tuned to find out more!

                  <h2>The Home Depot - Lantern</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Worked as a front-end developer during a summer internship <br/> for The Home Depot.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/hdlantern.jpg" alt="">
                  <h4>The Product</h4>
                  <p>Over the course of summer 2017, I was a Software Engineering Intern for The Home Depot. Within a group of seven interns, I held responsibility for developing the front-end for a data analytics web application for the Contact Center Experience Team. To develop the front-end, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React.js as a front-end library. I also had a prominent part in the design and user research for the application. The application aggregates and displays common categories that customers chat about with Home Depot Support. Users of the application can narrow down their results by applying filters to categories they select and eventually reach individual chat transcripts to understand customers' problems.</p>
                  <h4>The Process</h4>
                  <br/><h5>User Research</h5><p>The project itself started off as a conceptual idea to visualize support data. Thus, our team carried the app from inception to several iterations of implementation. We began with developing personas as well as ideating use cases. This allowed us to organize our ideas and cater to the stakeholders' wishes for the project. To better understand the needs of the support agents and potential users, I observed a Home Depot call center and sat in on user interviews. With a better understanding of our users' needs, we were able to create a well-defined problem statement for the users: <br/><br/>"The contact centers collect a lot of data on interactions (timestamps, transcripts, disposition categories, etc) but it is largely unused. There exists a need for an analytics tool to look at the big picture of what customers are contacting us about and why"</p>
                  <h5>Feature Ideation</h5><p>With a problem statement in mind and user research at hand, we were able to ideate features and develop a 2x2 matrix. This matrix contained features mapped based on difficulty to implement versus importance to the user. In addition to this, I participated in several design studios to create lo-fidelity mockups for the application. I also participated in a design critique of hi-fidelity mockups that were created for the application. Finally, we conducted usability tests with an interactive InVision prototype.</p>
                  <h5>Implementation</h5><p>Throughout this process, I took the feedback from our designs and translated that to our implementation. With the several interviews, observations, and usability tests our team completed, we were able to have a solid foundation to create a polished and valuable application. Ultimately, we implemented a large portion of the proposed features. At the end of the internship, our team was one of the few chosen to present a project in front of the Senior Vice President for Technology at The Home Depot.</p>

                  <center><p><i>Our intern board where all the magic happened</i></p></center>
                  <h4>The Reflection</h4>
                  <p>While working on this project, I was able to have a hand in multiple facets of the development and design process. This allowed me to learn a lot of new skills, such as pushing an application to production within an enterprise and creating feature boards. Ultimately, I gained a couple of key insights after the completion of the project:<br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Be open-minded and don't get stuck on one path</b></i>. When we initially began, we started with the idea that our users would be contact center supervisors or managers. However, through our user interviews and research, we learned that it would be much more valuable for Contact Center directors to use the application and share useful information. This taught me to be adaptable and understand how to maneuver with the changes in a project's requirements.<br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Ensure that every member of the team is on the same page through consistent communication</b></i>. Two members of our team worked remotely from Austin. Therefore, we had some initial issues with keeping them up-to-date with the most recent information. As a solution, we utilized Slack, Pivotal Tracker, and daily standup meetings to make sure that each team member was aware of what others were currently working on.

                  <h2>Atlanta Street Art Project</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">An Android app that allows users to explore street art throughout Atlanta.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/asapfull.png" alt="">
                  <h4>The Product</h4>
                  <p>The Atlanta Street Art Project displays images and locations of street art throughout Atlanta. Within a group of five, I had a significant role in the development and design of the app. It began as a yearlong capstone project and was continued as a side project so that I could see it through to completion.</p>
                  <h4>The Process</h4>
                  <p>The project began with user research along with sketching out potential design ideas. After lo-fidelity mockups were created, we conducted usability tests to ensure that our designs were on the right path. After this, I took the critiques from the tests and developed a hi-fidelity prototype with Sketch and InVision. Once we had a full design, we started the implementation process. I have since also designed a logo for the appd have had it published to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=comquintonj.github.atlantastreetartproject&hl=en">Google Play Store.</a> For a more detailed overview of the design process, be sure to read more on <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/57295767/Atlanta-Street-Art-Project">Behance</a>.</p>
                  <h4>The Reflection</h4>
                  <p>Due to the app being a capstone project, our team worked with a real-world client. As the client-liaison of the group, I was in charge of ensuring that they were happy with what our team was producing. In addition to this, the completion of a full Android appw ithin a group provided many new experiences for me. A couple of key takeaways from the project were:<br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Keep the client happy</b></i>. As the originator of the idea for the project, it was important for our group to ensure that the client was satisfied with the progress our team was making. This meant we had to hold biweekly meetings to show our user stories, design ideas, and our final implementation. <br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Seek help early and often</b></i>. While our whole team did learn a lot throughout the creation of the app, we definitely encountered obstacles along the way. If a team member was having issues, it was important for them to bring the problem to the group so that other members could help.</p>

                  <h2>Wayfarer App Design</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">A mockup for an app that creates a gamified hiking experience utilizing auditory cues.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/wayfarerfull.png" alt="">
                  <h4>The Product</h4>
                  <p>The goal of the project was simple: design a system that relies on auditory feedback to relay information to the user. Within a group of four, I helped to envision an app that revolves around finding and "collecting" points of interests while hiking. In particular, I was responsible for creating the visual interface and testing the usability of the app.</p>
                  <h4>The Process</h4>
                  <p>To begin with, a team member and I had an idea for creating a gamified hiking app. With our mutual interests in the outdoors, it seemed like an obvious fit. After doing some research, we found many apps that revolved around providing information to hikers, such as water sources and campsites. However, none had a focus or reward for finding interesting points along trails. After this initial market research, our team divided up to work on different aspects; two team members were in charge of generating unique sounds that would play when a user found a point of interest based on type, another group member created a Unity simulation to test our sounds, and I was responsible for designing the visual element of the app.<br/><br/>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/wayfarerfinaldesign.png" alt="">
                  <center><p><i>The Sketch workspace I used to design the screens for the app</i></p></center>
                  We then regrouped to carry out six usability tests that included the visual elements and auditory elements of the app. These tests allowed our team to understand a few misleading aspects. A few participants were confused by the "Activity" screen and felt as though previous activities would be shown there. As a result, the name for this screen was changed to "Start Trail". To test our auditory cues, we played the sounds for participants and had them guess what the sound could signify. These sounds included finding an overlook, a water source, a campsite, and many others. Ultimately, we made a few adjustments to the sound and felt that having a tutorial would be a valuable addition so that new users could quickly understand the various sounds. With these tests completed, our team was able to organize a final visual design and set of auditory cues to report our work. For an interactive prototype, please see the <a href="https://invis.io/SNEGR0N86">InVision Prototype</a> I created.</p>
                  <h4>The Reflection</h4>
                  <p>Working with an auditory-based interface was unique and offered one key insight for me:<br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Be detail oriented</b></i>. Auditory elements of applications are often disregarded in favor of visuals or other systems. Small details like having auditory cues can be extremely valuable for communicating information and ensuring that your app is usable. Reduced errors also result in an ultimately satisfied user.</p>

                  <h2>STAR</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">An Android app that allows users who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with others quickly through the use of speech-to-text.</p>
                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/starfull.png" alt="">
                  <h4>The Product</h4>
                  <p>STAR allows users who are deaf or hard of hearing to utilize speech-to-text and text-to-speech in order to hold conversations with others. It is meant as a bridge for communication between the users and those who do not know American Sign Language. The app acts as a standard messaging app, where users can type what they would like to say into the text field. The person they are talking to can then use the microphone to respond to the user. The app also uses location as a tool for context awareness. The presets at the bottom of the interface are dynamic depending on the user's surrounding area. Finally, users can have multiple conversations available to them and their message history is persistent. Thus, if they are in the same location again, they can pull up their old messages so that they do not have to repeat the process.</p>
                  <h4>The Process</h4>
                  <p>At the beginning of the project, our team met with a Georgia Tech Research Scientist to understand the needs of the project. We discovered that a prior version of the app lacked intuitive usability and had a codebase that was difficult to refactor. Therefore, we decided to implement the project and rectify the errors of the first implementation. We began by ideating use cases. Following from this, I created and edited a brief video demo to demonstrate our progress and design ideas. We then received feedback and began implementing the app. Throughout the process of implementation, our team consistently received feedback from peers and our mentor to ensure that we were meeting the proper requirements for the app.</p>
                  <h4>The Reflection</h4>
                  <p>While working on the project, there were many opportunities to receive constructive criticism and feedback about the app. Ultimately, this led to a better user experience and gave our team concrete items to improve. This left me with one major insight:<br/><br/>
                  <i><b>Be open to criticism of your work</b></i>. By showing the video demos and talking about the app to our mentor and peers, our team was able to learn about what we were doing wrong. We realized that these were not personal attacks, but ways for us to create an overall better product.</p>
