								<h1>Home Depot - <br/>UX Designer</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">Working as a UX designer at The Home Depot</p>
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>Since the summer of 2018, I have been working as a UX Designer for The Home Depot. Within the Enterprise UX team, I work within repair products to ensure Home Depot associates are able to quickly and efficiently work on repairs. My team maintains three main work streams: Repair Depot, Repair Tracker, and Repair Queues. I have produced, tested, and validated designs for each product and have had a hand in assisting the UX team at large through collaborations and design pairing.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<h5>Repair Tracker</h5>
								<p>An issue in which numerous associates had within Home Depot stores was locating repairs. This is due to certain stores lacking a Tool Rental Center, and therefore, some tools need to be shipped out for repair. In order to track the location and status of the repair, associates used to have to contact multiple parties to figure out where the tool is. This caused issues when customers had dropped off tools and returned to the store after a period of time to figure out the status of their repair. Through multiple research sessions, it was found that when customers asked about the status, the associates couldn’t get a response until up to 48 hours later.</p>
								<p>Repair Tracker thus had the objective of being able to easily find the status of a given repair by looking up the tag number within a web app. This would allow associates to search a tag and see notes, updates, and have the ability to contact necessary parties without having to wait for multiple days to receive an answer. I held responsibility in designing Repair Tracker and conducting a total of 8 usability tests, including three in a Home Depot UX Testing lab. I also held numerous user research sessions to ensure pain points were confirmed as well as to ensure all necessary stakeholders were included. Since my assistance, the Repair Tracker application has been launched to more than 800 stores.</p>
								<h5>Repair Depot</h5>
								<p>The current method of maintaining repairs for Home Depot is cumbersome, unintuitive, and requires a multitude of systems. The main goal of Repair Depot is to replace these systems with a singular app that is able to accomplish the management of repairs and ordering parts. Since joining the team, I have led efforts to add the functionality of maintaining inventory, as well as fully managing work on repairs for tools. This includes the ability to create a repair, add parts and labor, and complete the repair. Repair Depot has been launched to 9 stores and will be launched to dozens more during the first half of 2019.</p>
								<p>To research Repair Depot, I have conducted 8 usability tests with technicians in Home Depot stores. I have also led several design critiques, in which I requested feedback from fellow designers on the Enterprise UX team. To ideate future features and how they would look, I also conducted a design studio in which people developed ideas for features with pen and paper. All of this allowed personal growth for me as a designer, as it gave me the opportunity to collaborate with my peers and learn from others.</p>
								<h4>The Reflection</h4>
								<p>Thus far, Home Depot has been a great place to work and I have been looking forward to what more I can learn from my experience here. The Enterprise UX team at large has given me the opportunity to consistently learn from others, as well as hone in my communication and collaboration skills. Finally, working within a balanced team has given me new insights into the agile methodology and employed skills I have learned from college in a real-world setting.</p>
								<p>Grow your personal brand. Within an Enterprise environment, it has been important for me to grow my professional skills in addition to my skills as a designer. This means I have had to grow into my own space within the UX team and grow my own personal brand and perception among my peers.</p>

								<h1>RagShot</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">A ragdoll slingshot simulator</p>
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>RagShot is a 3D Puzzle Action game developed in Unity that involves the use of rag dolls to destroy the enemy’s castle. As part of a group of five, I was in charge of handling the menus, in-game UI programming, and writing the storyline as part of our design document. In the game, the player controls a character that runs around the environment in attempt to avoid enemy attacks while dismantling the castle with their limited supply of ragdolls. A score is given to the player based on the level of destruction they are able to achieve, lending itself to scoring stars for levels.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>We began by implementing a basic version of the game mechanics: a barebones menu with a level to test movement and the shooting interaction. Following from this, we were able to solicit feedback from classmates, teaching assistants, and the professor. With extensive playtesting, We found that the core mechanics were fun and interesting, but an extra layer of complexity definitely needed to be added and the basis for the game needed to be difficult. As a result, I started working on a polished UI and brainstorming more unique and complex gameplay elements. Meanwhile, our team developed lush environments and added additional levels as well as created a dense castle. With a more built up experience, we were able to gain additional critiques and polish off certain aspects that were causing confusion among players. With a final version in hand, we came away from the project having learned a significant amount and had a sense of pride in creating something fun.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>Working with Unity was fun and exciting for me, as I hadn’t previously gotten the chance to try it out. Coming away from the project I also felt excited about creating a complete experience. Looking back on the project I left with one main insight:</p>
								<p>Ensure the core foundation in your experience is strong. Starting off with the project, we focused on the basic interactions, movement, and user experience and made sure that was something that is fun and intuitive. Without this basis, the project would have failed. Luckily, we were able to garner constant feedback and created something that felt enjoyable to play.</p>

								<h1>Wayfarer <br/>App Mockup</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">A mockup for an app that creates a gamified hiking experience utilizing auditory cues.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/wayfarerfull.png">
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>The goal of the project was simple: design a system that relies on auditory feedback to relay information to the user. Within a group of four, I helped to envision an app that revolves around finding and "collecting" points of interests while hiking. In particular, I was responsible for creating the visual interface and testing the usability of the app.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>To begin with, a team member and I had an idea for creating a gamified hiking app. With our mutual interests in the outdoors, it seemed like an obvious fit. After doing some market research, we found many apps that revolved around providing information to hikers, such as water sources and campsites. However, none had a focus or reward for finding interesting points along trails. After this initial market research, our team divided up to work on different aspects; two team members were in charge of generating unique sounds that would play when a user found a point of interest based on type, another group member created a Unity simulation to test our sounds, and I was responsible for designing the visual piece of the app.<br>
								<br>
								<img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/wayfarerfinaldesign.png"></p>
								<center>
									<p><i>The Sketch workspace I used to design the screens for the app</i></p>
								</center>
								<p>We then regrouped to carry out six usability tests that included the visual and auditory elements of the app. These tests allowed our team to understand a few misleading aspects. A few participants were confused by the "Activity" screen and felt as though previous activities would be shown there. As a result, the name for this screen was changed to "Start Trail". To test our auditory cues, we played the sounds for participants and had them guess what the sound could signify. These sounds included finding an overlook, a water source, a campsite, and many others. Ultimately, we made a few adjustments to the sound and felt that having a tutorial would be a valuable addition so that new users could quickly understand the various sounds. With these tests completed, our team was able to organize a final visual design and set of auditory cues to report our work. For an interactive prototype, please see the <a href="https://invis.io/SNEGR0N86">InVision Prototype</a> I created.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>Working with an auditory-based interface was unique and offered one key insight for me:</p>
								<p>Be detail oriented. Auditory elements of applications are often disregarded in favor of visuals or other systems. Small details like having auditory cues can be extremely valuable for communicating information and ensuring that your app is usable. Reduced errors also result in an ultimately satisfied user.</p>

								<h1>Food Fight</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">A 2D action game made with Processing and Arduino</p><video controls=""><source src="img/portfolio/foodfightvideo.mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
								<p></p>
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>Food Fight is a 2D multiplayer game that was developed with Processing and utilizes two “food trays” made up of capacitors and two Arduinos. Within a group of four, I handled all of the game’s programming, gave design input, and assisted with soldering and building the boards. To play the game, a player pulls back a spoon to fling food at the other player. There are options to switch to Jello, meatballs, peas, and mashed potatoes, each with their own unique attributes. This is done via capacitors connected to an Arduino breadboard that allow the user to tap their spoon to the tray to switch food. There is also a tilt sensor on the board that allows the user to flip up the tray to block incoming food. The first player to get the other’s health points down to 0 wins!</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/foodfightfull.png">
								<center>
									<p><i>A screenshot from the game</i></p>
								</center>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>The game design process began with the objective to create a game using a unique controller similar to Steel Battalion or Dance Dance Revolution. Our team thus set off to brainstorm a few different ideas. The initial idea came from the desire to have a two-player fighting game that revolved around a basic food fight. With the game foundation in mind, we set out to build the initial functionality to provide a proof-of-concept. This involved using a spoon with a capacitor to control an arrow on the screen. Following from this, I was able to implement the ability to shoot an object after releasing the spoon. I also began developing more features, such as controlling the physics of the different food items, including the backgrounds, and creating the environment. Meanwhile, our group created the trays and art assets for the game.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/foodfightcontroller.jpg">
								<center>
									<p><i>One controller for the game</i></p>
								</center>
								<p>With additional feedback from another round of playtesting I conducted, I was able to fine-tune the shooting mechanics to ensure that the game was not too easy or too hard. I also tweaked the physics of each item and the threshold for flinging food and how much pressure was placed on the spoon. We were also successful in creating a second food tray and spoon. Thus, I was able to implement the last piece of the puzzle by controlling the two controller inputs at once. The final result was a bizarre, yet hilarious game.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>Having come from a design and development background, I was completely out of my element when it came to soldering and working with microcontrollers. Despite this, I was successful in my collaboration with the team and my assistance with the project. This led me to one main conclusion:</p>
								<p>Don’t be afraid to learn new things. This project gave me a chance to improve and work on a variety of new skill-sets including physical prototyping, working with Processing, and soldering. As a result, I was able to learn a lot of new things and came away much more knowledgeable and confident in my abilities.</p>

								<h1>Home Depot - Intern</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">Worked as a front-end developer during a summer internship<br>
								for The Home Depot.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/hdlantern.jpg">
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>Over the course of summer 2017, I was a Software Engineering Intern for The Home Depot. Within a group of seven interns, I held responsibility for developing the front-end for a data analytics web application for the Contact Center Experience Team. To develop the front-end, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React.js as a front-end library. I also had a prominent part in the design and user research for the application. The application aggregates and displays common categories that customers chat about with Home Depot Support. Users of the application can narrow down their results by applying filters to categories they select and eventually reach individual chat transcripts to understand customers' problems.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<h5>User Research</h5>
								<p>The project itself started off as a conceptual idea to visualize support data. Thus, our team carried the app from inception to several iterations of implementation. We began with developing personas as well as ideating use cases. This allowed us to organize our ideas and cater to the stakeholders' wishes for the project. To better understand the needs of the support agents and potential users, I observed a Home Depot call center and sat in on user interviews. With a better understanding of our users' needs, we were able to create a well-defined problem statement for the users:<br />
								"The contact centers collect a lot of data on interactions (timestamps, transcripts, disposition categories, etc) but it is largely unused. There exists a need for an analytics tool to look at the big picture of what customers are contacting us about and why"</p>
								<h5>Feature Ideation</h5>
								<p>With a problem statement in mind and user research at hand, we were able to ideate features and develop a 2x2 matrix. This matrix contained features mapped based on difficulty to implement versus importance to the user. In addition to this, I participated in several design studios to create lo-fidelity mockups for the application. I also participated in a design critique of hi-fidelity mockups that were created for the application. Finally, we conducted usability tests with an interactive InVision prototype.</p>
								<h5>Implementation</h5>
								<p>Throughout this process, I took the feedback from our designs and translated that to our implementation. With the several interviews, observations, and usability tests our team completed, we were able to have a solid foundation to create a polished and valuable application. Ultimately, we implemented a large portion of the proposed features. At the end of the internship, our team was one of the few chosen to present a project in front of the Senior Vice President for Technology at The Home Depot.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/danternsboard.png">

									<p><i>Our intern board where all the magic happened</i></p>
								</center>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>While working on this project, I was able to have a hand in multiple facets of the development and design process. This allowed me to learn a lot of new skills, such as pushing an application to production within an enterprise and creating feature boards. Ultimately, I gained a couple of key insights after the completion of the project:</p>
								<p>Be open-minded and don't get stuck on one path. When we initially began, we started with the idea that our users would be Contact Center supervisors or managers. However, through our user interviews and research, we learned that it would be much more valuable for Contact Center directors to use the application and share useful information. This taught me to be adaptable and understand how to maneuver with the changes in a project's requirements.</p>
								<p>Ensure that every member of the team is on the same page through consistent communication. Two members of our team worked remotely from Austin. Therefore, we had some initial issues with keeping them up-to-date with the most recent information. As a solution, we utilized Slack, Pivotal Tracker, and daily standup meetings to make sure that each team member was aware of what others were currently working on.</p>

								<h1>Atlanta Street <br/>Art Project</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">An Android app that allows users to explore street art throughout Atlanta.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/asapfull.png">
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>The Atlanta Street Art Project displays images and locations of street art throughout Atlanta. Within a group of five, I had a significant role in the development and design of the app. It began as a yearlong capstone project and was continued as a side project so that I could see it through to completion.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>The project began with user research along with sketching out potential design ideas. After lo-fidelity mockups were created, we conducted usability tests to ensure that our designs were on the right path. After this, I took the critiques from the tests and developed a hi-fidelity prototype with Sketch and InVision. Once we had a full design, we started the implementation process. I have since also designed a logo for the app and have had it published to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=comquintonj.github.atlantastreetartproject&hl=en">Google Play Store.</a> For a more detailed overview of the design process, be sure to read more on <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/57295767/Atlanta-Street-Art-Project">Behance</a>.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>Due to the app being a capstone project, our team worked with a real-world client. As the client-liaison of the group, I was in charge of ensuring that they were happy with what our team was producing. In addition to this, the completion of a full Android app within a group provided many new experiences for me. A couple of key takeaways from the project were:</p>
								<p>Keep the client happy. As the originator of the idea for the project, it was important for our group to ensure that the client was satisfied with the progress our team was making. This meant we had to hold biweekly meetings to show our user stories, design ideas, and our final implementation.</p>
								<p>Seek help early and often. While our whole team did learn a lot throughout the creation of the app, we definitely encountered obstacles along the way. If a team member was having issues, it was important for them to bring the problem to the group so that other members could help.</p>

								<h1>STAR</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">An Android app that allows users who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with others quickly through the use of speech-to-text.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/starfull.png">
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>STAR allows users who are deaf or hard of hearing to utilize speech-to-text and text-to-speech in order to hold conversations with others. It is meant as a bridge for communication between the users and those who do not know American Sign Language. The app acts as a standard messaging app, where users can type what they would like to say into the text field. The person they are talking to can then use the microphone to respond to the user. The app also uses location as a tool for context awareness. The presets at the bottom of the interface are dynamic depending on the user's surrounding area. Finally, users can have multiple conversations available to them and their message history is persistent. Thus, if they are in the same location again, they can pull up their old messages so that they do not have to repeat the process.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>At the beginning of the project, our team met with a Georgia Tech Research Scientist to understand the needs of the project. We discovered that a prior version of the app lacked intuitive usability and had a codebase that was difficult to refactor. Therefore, we decided to implement the project and rectify the errors of the first implementation. We began by ideating use cases. Following from this, I created and edited a brief video demo to demonstrate our progress and design ideas. We then received feedback and began implementing the app. Throughout the process of implementation, our team consistently received feedback from peers and our mentor to ensure that we were meeting the proper requirements for the app.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>While working on the project, there were many opportunities to receive constructive criticism and feedback about the app. Ultimately, this led to a better user experience and gave our team concrete items to improve. This left me with one major insight:</p>
								<p>Be open to criticism of your work. By showing the video demos and talking about the app to our mentor and peers, our team was able to learn about what we were doing wrong. We realized that these were not personal attacks, but ways for us to create an overall better product.</p>

								<h1>Guide to <br/>Brewing Coffee</h1>
								<p class="item-intro">A poster design based on user research that describes how to brew a cup of coffee.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/coffeefull.jpg">
								<h3>The Product</h3>
								<p>This poster design was the result of several ethnographic observation sessions with a coffee enthusiast. It was created using Photoshop with Gestalt Principles in mind. During these sessions, I wrote notes, drew sketches, and took pictures to understand the process. Following this, I compiled and analyzed my notes to gain insights from the user and designed this poster to show my findings.</p>
								<h3>The Process</h3>
								<p>The initial development of the poster required user research. Therefore, I grabbed a friend who is a coffee enthusiast and asked to observe him for his normal coffee routine. This gave me the opportunity to survey his procedure and how he handled making a quality cup of coffee. I utilized an AEIOU framework: activities, environment, interactions, objects, and users. This allowed me to capture all of the elements that were involved with my friend’s process. Throughout this, I also took pictures and jotted down notes in my notebook.</p><img alt="" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/coffeejournal.png">
								<center>
									<p><i>My notes for the observation</i></p>
								</center>
								<p>With the user research completed over a couple of scenarios, I reflected on my findings. This allowed me to distill one key insight – “It is necessary to take grind size, weight of the beans, weight of the water, and temperature of the water into account when creating the perfect cup of coffee”. With this one key insight, I began to design around it by creating an infographic for a step-by-step brewing guide.</p>
								<h3>The Reflection</h3>
								<p>This project allowed me to work on my observation skills and reflects a process I still use this day to ensure all of my designs are backed by research and well thought out. This resulted in an important finding for me:</p>
								<p>Quality research leads to quality designs. Completing user research allows the designer to identify and analyze all aspects of a problem to ensure that the design correctly addresses the user’s pain points and creates a seamless experience. After all, that’s what design is all about; create a design that will be intuitive and solve problems.</p>
